Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
with small simulations prediction shows that the percentage of winning
is higher and timing of simulation is more quikly than doing it with high
simulations prediction from 10000 to 1000000, takes more time to show the prediction and almost the same prediction
in my case from 1000 the prédiction is always the same the belgium is the winner 20%

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations
the prédiction is always the same the belgium is the winner 20%
